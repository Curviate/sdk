/**
 * Internal request context shared by every resource namespace.
 *
 * A `RequestContext` binds the resolved client config to a `request` function
 * and (optionally) a fixed `account_id` injected on every call — the mechanism
 * behind `curviate.account(id).<resource>`. Resources never touch the transport
 * directly; they call `ctx.request(...)`.
 *
 * Account-first path grammar: an account-scoped method declares its path
 * template with a leading `{account_id}` placeholder (e.g.
 * `/v1/{account_id}/chats/${chatId}`); the bound context substitutes the fixed
 * account id into that placeholder. `account_id` is therefore always a path
 * segment — never a query param, never a body field. Root-scoped namespaces
 * (`accounts`, `auth`, `webhooks`) are built with a context that carries no
 * account id, so their paths (which have no placeholder) are used verbatim.
 *
 * Each resource takes a `RequestContext` and maps one method to one `/v1/*`
 * operation.
