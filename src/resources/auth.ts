/**
 * Auth resource — credential/cookie connect + checkpoint resolution.
 *
 * Split out of `accounts` into its own root-scoped namespace: these 5 ops
 * drive the multi-step "connect or re-authenticate a LinkedIn account" flow,
 * which is conceptually distinct from managing an already-connected account.
 * `intent` merges the old `accounts.link` (new account) and `accounts.reconnect`
 * (existing account) into one op, discriminated by an optional `account_id` in
 * the body — omit it to connect a new account, include it to re-authenticate
 * an existing one in place.
 *
 * None of these methods take an `account_id` path segment: the account is
 * either absent (new connect) or a body field (`account_id`) that identifies
 * a mid-flight connect/reconnect, never a path placeholder.

  /**
   * Authenticate a LinkedIn account with credentials or a session cookie.

   * Omit `account_id` to connect a NEW account into an empty seat; include it
   * to re-authenticate an EXISTING account in place. Returns the account on
   * success (200 re-authenticated in place / 201 new), or a checkpoint
   * challenge (202) when LinkedIn requires verification — resolve it with
   * {@link solveCheckpoint} (code) or {@link pollCheckpoint} (mobile-app
   * approval).
   *
   * For `auth_method: "cookie"`, `user_agent` is **required** — connecting by
   * session cookie without one is rejected with `INVALID_REQUEST`. It stays
   * optional for `auth_method: "credentials"`.
   *
   * On a 201 account, `recovered` is `true` only when the connect reclaimed a
   * LinkedIn identity already present on the workspace (claiming it into your
   * account) rather than connecting a brand-new one — it is absent on a normal
   * connect.
   *
   * Connection scope (which LinkedIn products are enabled — classic, company,
   * a premium tier) is **seat-derived**: there is no products input on this
   * body, and the recorded scope is readable back as `requested_products` on
   * the account (`accounts.list()` / `accounts.get()`). A reconnect that
   * would change scope must use `auth_method: "credentials"` — a cookie
   * replay cannot change scope and throws `CurviateError(code:
   * "REAUTH_REQUIRED")`. A seat resolving to both individual-Premium tiers at
   * once throws `CurviateError(code: "PREMIUM_CONFLICT")` — LinkedIn permits
   * only one per profile. Pin a managed proxy with the optional `country`/`ip`,
   * or supply `proxy` to override it entirely.
