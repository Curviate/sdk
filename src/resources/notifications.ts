/**
 * Notifications resource — 3 methods (NEW namespace).
 *
 * Account-scoped: the bound context injects `account_id` as the leading
 * `/v1/` path segment on every request (account-first grammar) — never a
 * query param or body field.
 *
 * The connected account's own notification centre: list its cards, delete
 * one, or apply "show less like this" to one. Both writes are self-actions
 * — they act only on the account's OWN cards and never notify or touch a
 * third party. Both share a `card_urn` path param: the card's ENTITY urn
 * (`urn:li:fsd_notificationCard:(…)`, the `card_urn` field of a
 * {@link NotificationsResource.list} item) — not its secondary `object_urn`,
 * which targets the wrong notification. A card urn embeds `(`, `)`, `:`,
 * `,`; pass it to `delete`/`showLess` raw — the SDK percent-encodes it into
 * the path segment, and the server decodes it back.
 *
 * Both writes are **idempotent** and **effective within a few seconds**:
 * deleting (or show-lessing) a card that is already gone succeeds with 200,
 * not an error — only a `card_urn` that never existed on this account 404s.
 * A `list()` read immediately after a write may still include the card for
 * a moment; that alone is not a failure signal — the 200 already confirms
 * the card was resolved and the removal accepted. (An early, unverified
 * assumption of a ~30s eventual-consistency window did not hold up under
 * measurement — removal lands in ~2-6s in practice; re-read after a short
 * delay, not instantly, if you need to confirm.)
