## [Unreleased]

## [0.16.0] — 2026-07-17

Mostly additive, plus one breaking removal on the connect/reconnect body.

### Breaking

- **`disabled_features` is removed from `auth.intent()`'s request body**
  (`AuthIntentBody`) — the negative-list model could not express the `company`
  product or the one-Premium-per-profile XOR. Connection scope (which
  LinkedIn products get synced) is now **seat-derived**: there is no products
  input on connect/reconnect at all. Drop any `disabled_features` you were
  passing — a body still carrying it is now rejected 400 by the server. The
  scope actually recorded for an account reads back as the new
  `requested_products` field (see Added, below). A reconnect that changes
  scope must use `auth_method: "credentials"` — a cookie replay cannot change
  scope and now throws `CurviateError(code: "REAUTH_REQUIRED")`.

### Added

- **New account-scoped `inboxes` namespace (2 methods, Beta)** —
  `inboxes.list(query?)` discovers the account's personal inbox plus, when
  the company product is attached, one entry per company page × folder (id
  like `"COMPANY_83734124_PRIMARY"`); `inboxes.listChats(inboxId, query?)`
  lists a single inbox's conversations, cursor-paginated. Every returned chat
  `id` is send-ready — pass it straight to the existing
  `messaging.sendMessage()` to reply; no separate start/send endpoint for
  company pages, which are reply-only (`reply_only: true`) and cannot start
  a new conversation. **Beta:** single-page listing is verified; deep
  pagination against a busier inbox is still being validated.
- **`sendMessage()` echoes the acting identity as `sent_as`** — additive on
  the existing send-message response. A `COMPANY_` chat id (from
  `inboxes.listChats()`) sends AS THE PAGE and echoes
  `sent_as: { kind: "company", company_id, name }` (`company_id` may be
  `null` when the page could not be correlated to a managed page); any other
  chat id sends as the connected member and echoes
  `sent_as: { kind: "personal" }`. Never infer the acting identity from a
  message's `sender` field.
- **`accounts.list()` / `accounts.get()` gain `requested_products`** — the
  seat-derived connection scope (e.g. `["classic", "company",
  "sales_navigator"]`) the account was last connected with. `null` for
  accounts connected before this was recorded; not attachment truth for
  Company Pages (that is decidable only via `inboxes.list()`).
- **Two new error codes** — `PREMIUM_CONFLICT` (a seat resolving to both
  individual-Premium tiers at once — LinkedIn permits only one per profile;
  `user_fixable`, never retryable) and `REAUTH_REQUIRED` (a scope-changing
  reconnect attempted with a cookie instead of credentials; `user_fixable`,
  never retryable).
- **New account-scoped `profile` namespace (4 methods)** — the connected
  account's own insight surface: `profile.subscription()`, `profile.analytics()`,
  `profile.visitors(query?)`, `profile.ssi()`. Distinct from the retired
  `profiles` namespace (renamed to `users` in 0.15.0).
- **New account-scoped `groups` namespace (3 methods)** — `groups.list(query?)`
  (own groups by default, or another member's via `{ profile }`),
  `groups.get(group)`, and `groups.members(group, query?)` (with the folded-in
  `{ name }` member search).
- **New account-scoped `feed` namespace (1 method)** — `feed.home(query?)` reads
  the connected account's home feed as agent-actionable posts, with `relevant`
  or `recent` sort orders.
- **`companies` gains 3 company-insights methods** — `companies.managed(query?)`
  lists the pages the connected account administers; `companies.followers(identifier,
  query?)` lists a page's followers (**re-added** under a different item shape —
  `company_follower`, carrying `degree`/`followed_at` — than the pre-0.15.0
  method of the same name); `companies.invitableFollowers(identifier, query?)`
  lists connections invitable to follow the page. All three require the
  connected account to administer the target page.
- **`companies` gains 5 Beta company-inbox methods** — `companies.chats(identifier,
  query?)`, `companies.chat(identifier, chatId)`, `companies.messages(identifier,
  chatId, query?)`, `companies.message(identifier, chatId, messageId)`, and
  `companies.searchChats(identifier, query?)` (exactly one of `query`/`topic`/
  `unread` per call). A distinct conversation surface from the account's own
  `messaging` namespace, scoped to one administered company page. **Beta:**
  single-page listing and termination are verified; deep pagination (many
  pages / large cursor round-trips) is still being validated against a busier
  inbox. `companies` is now 12 methods (was 4).
- **`search` gains 3 methods** — `search.groups(query)` searches LinkedIn
  groups by keyword; `search.services(body & query)` searches Services
  Marketplace providers with structured filters; `search.getServiceParameters(query)`
  resolves human-readable service-category/location terms into the opaque
  filter ids `services()` accepts. `search` is now 9 methods (was 6).
- **`messaging` gains 1 method** — `messaging.searchChats(params)` free-text
  searches the account's own inbox (participant names and message content).
  `messaging` is now 13 methods (was 12).
- **`posts` gains 3 saved-posts methods** — `posts.listSaved(query?)` lists the
  connected account's own saved posts (a self resource — previews only,
  `snippet` capped at ≤140 chars, never the full body); `posts.save(postId)`
  and `posts.unsave(postId)` add/remove a bookmark, both idempotent and
  accepting either `urn:li:activity:<id>` or a bare numeric id. `posts` is now
  12 methods (was 9).
- **New account-scoped `notifications` namespace (3 methods)** — the connected
  account's own notification centre: `notifications.list(query?)` (cards +
  the account-level `unread_count`/`latest_published_at`);
  `notifications.delete(cardUrn)` and `notifications.showLess(cardUrn)`, two
  self-action writes on the account's own cards. Both writes are idempotent
  and take effect within a few seconds — a list read immediately after may
  still show the card for a moment, which is not a failure signal. The SDK
  percent-encodes `cardUrn` (which embeds `(`, `)`, `:`, `,`) into the path.
- **Parity pin: 143 methods across 18 namespaces** (was 135 / 16 at the start
  of this release cycle) — the `inboxes` namespace is the final addition.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-07-11

Full v2 parity. The SDK is re-aligned 1:1 to the served API surface: every
operation is now exactly one method at the exact wire encoding, the entire
account-scoped surface moves to the account-first path grammar, and three
namespaces are reorganized. This is a **breaking** release touching nearly
every namespace. The five breaking categories below — removals, namespace
reorganization, method renames/relocations, request/response shape changes, and
the account-first path-grammar migration — are the complete set of breaks a
`0.14.1` → `0.15.0` upgrade must reconcile, gathered here so a consumer finds
every break in one place.

### Removed (BREAKING)

- **14 methods that map to no served operation are removed, with no alias:**
  - `accounts.createConnectLink()`, `accounts.createReconnectLink()`, `accounts.reconnect()` — hosted connect/reconnect link minting and in-place reconnect are no longer part of the API surface.
  - `messaging.syncChat()`, `messaging.syncMessages()`, `recruiter.syncMessages()`, `salesNavigator.syncMessages()` — explicit sync operations are gone; accounts sync continuously and deliver via webhooks.
  - `posts.list()` — the standalone feed list has no served operation (use `posts.listUserPosts(userId)` for a member's posts).
  - `companies.followers()` — no served operation.
  - `recruiter.addApplicant()`, `recruiter.rejectApplicant()`, `recruiter.solveJobCheckpoint()` — superseded by the project-centric pipeline surface.
  - `webhooks.getStateDiff()` — no served operation.
- **`invites.respond()` is removed** — split into two dedicated bodyless methods, `invites.accept(invitationId)` and `invites.decline(invitationId)` (see below).
- **`profiles.getCompany()` stays removed** — dropped ahead of this release with no return; company reads live on the `companies` namespace.

### Changed (BREAKING) — namespaces reorganized

- **`profiles` namespace renamed to `users`.** Every `curviate.account(id).profiles.*` call becomes `…users.*`; the served group is "Users" and every path is `/users/{user_id}`.
- **New root-scoped `auth` namespace, split out of `accounts`.** The connect/checkpoint operations move off `accounts`: `accounts.link` → `auth.intent`, `accounts.solveCheckpoint` → `auth.solveCheckpoint`, plus `auth.requestCheckpoint`, `auth.pollCheckpoint`, and `accounts.getConnectSession` → `auth.getSession(sessionId)`. `accounts` now carries only `list` / `get` / `update` / `disconnect`.
- **New account-scoped `comments` namespace.** The comment-thread surface (create / edit / delete / reply / list replies / reactions) plus the relocated `listUserComments` live here rather than on `posts`.
- **Root and account surfaces are now strictly disjoint.** The root client exposes only `accounts`, `auth`, `webhooks`. Every other namespace is reachable exclusively through `curviate.account(id)` — the account-scoped namespaces are no longer mounted on the root client (they cannot build a valid path without a bound `account_id`).

### Changed (BREAKING) — methods renamed / relocated

- `profiles.endorse(userId, { skill_endorsement_id })` → **`users.endorseSkill(userId, { endorsement_id })`** — renamed, and the body key changed from `skill_endorsement_id` to `endorsement_id`.
- `profiles.listConnections()` → **`users.listRelations()`**.
- `messaging.getInMailBalance()` → **`users.getInMailCredits()`** (relocated onto `users`).
- `posts.comment(postId, …)` → **`comments.create(postId, …)`**.
- `profiles.listComments(userId)` → **`comments.listUserComments(userId)`**.
- `profiles.listPosts(userId)` → **`posts.listUserPosts(userId)`**.
- `profiles.listReactions(userId)` → **`posts.listUserReactions(userId)`**.
- `invites.respond(...)` → **`invites.accept(invitationId)` / `invites.decline(invitationId)`** (split; both bodyless).
- `recruiter.addCandidate(...)` → **`recruiter.saveCandidate(projectId, { stage_id, candidate_id })`**.
- `recruiter.getParameters(...)` (GET) → **`recruiter.searchParameters(body)` (POST)** — the HTTP verb changed GET→POST, with a `source`-discriminated body.
- `recruiter.listProjectJobs(projectId)` → **`recruiter.getProjectJob(projectId)`** — the operation returns the single attached job posting, not a list.

### Changed (BREAKING) — request / response shapes

- **`users.update(userId, body)`** never sends `description`; accepted keys are `{ first_name, last_name, headline, bio, skills, picture, background_picture }`.
- **`users.endorseSkill`** body key is `endorsement_id` (was `skill_endorsement_id`).
- **`jobs.publish` / `recruiter.publishJob`** take a `mode`-discriminated body (`FREE` | `PROMOTED` | `PROMOTED_PLUS`; the `PROMOTED*` modes require a `budget { currency, amount, scope }`) and respond `{ object, job_state }`.
- **`jobs.close` / `recruiter.closeJob`** are bodyless POSTs responding `{ object }`.
- **`invites.cancel`** withdrawal now discriminates on `invitation_withdrawn`.
- **Message operations are re-homed under the chat.** `getMessage` / `editMessage` / `deleteMessage` / `addReaction` / `getAttachment` now path under `/chats/{chat_id}/messages/…` and take `chatId` as the leading argument.
- **`messaging.sendInMail`** body drops the `surface` field.
- **Media-bearing writes moved from multipart to JSON + base64** where the surface retired multipart (recruiter, sales-navigator, posts, messaging); read each operation's declared content-type — some remain multipart.
- **Sales Navigator `saveAccount` / `saveLead` bodies shrank** to the minimal saved-entity shape.
- **`recruiter.startChat`** now requires a `signature` (alongside `attendees_ids`, `text`, `subject`).
- **`recruiter.createJob`** now requires `project_name` and responds `{ job_id, object, project_id }` (was a full job object).
- **`recruiter.saveCandidate`** body is `{ stage_id, candidate_id }`.

### Changed (BREAKING) — account-first path grammar

- **Every account-scoped method now carries `account_id` as the leading path segment** (`/v1/{account_id}/…`), never as a query parameter, body field, or omitted. Bind it once with `curviate.account(id)` and it is injected on every call. Companies and relations, which previously carried `account_id` as a query argument, drop it entirely.

### Added

- **`comments` namespace (9 methods):** `listUserComments`, `create`, `edit`, `delete`, `reply`, `listReplies`, `listReactions`, `addReaction`, `removeReaction` — `removeReaction` is a DELETE that carries a `{ reaction }` body.
- **`jobs` write surface (9 new methods):** `list`, `create`, `update`, `getBudget`, `publish`, `close`, `listApplicants`, `getApplicant`, `downloadResume` (binary `ArrayBuffer`). `jobs.create` takes object-shaped `job_title` / `company` and a `method`-discriminated `apply_method`.
- **Project-centric `recruiter` surface (9 new methods):** `searchTalentPool`, `searchFromUrl`, `updateProject`, `listPipeline`, `getProjectJob`, `createProjectJob`, `getProjectJobBudget`, `updateProjectJob`, `closeJob`, with `getApplicant` / `downloadResume` re-homed under the project scope.
- **`users.follow` / `users.unfollow`** (bodyless POST / DELETE), **`users.listFollowing`**, **`users.update`**.
- **`messaging.markChatRead(chatId, { read })`**.
- **`search.fromUrl({ url })`** and **`salesNavigator.searchFromUrl({ url })`** — resolve a LinkedIn search-results URL into a search.
- **`posts.delete`** (bodyless, 204) and **`posts.unreact(postId, { reaction })`** (DELETE with body).
- **`users.get(userId)` accepts `'me'`** — `users.get('me')` reads the caller's own profile (folds in the old `getMe`).
- **New `ErrorCode` value: `LINKEDIN_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED`.** The `422` a permanent LinkedIn platform limitation for the attempted operation returns (e.g. listing a non-self user's following list) — `user_fixable: true`, `retry_likely_to_succeed: false` (not a transient failure; retrying will not help). Added to the `ErrorCode` union and the transport's known-code set — previously this narrowed to `INTERNAL`, which is retryable.

### Fixed

- **`CONNECTION_REQUEST_CONFLICT` was silently downgraded to `INTERNAL`.** The `409` the API returns when a connect-request to a member already exists (or you are already a first-degree connection) is a real, documented error code, but the transport's runtime known-code set omitted it — so callers received `code: "INTERNAL"` with the wrong semantics (`INTERNAL` is retryable, whereas this conflict is `user_fixable: true`, `retry_likely_to_succeed: false` and must never be re-sent). The transport now decodes `CONNECTION_REQUEST_CONFLICT` to itself. To eliminate the class of bug: the `ErrorCode` type and the transport's runtime known-code set are now both **derived from one source array**, so the code a caller narrows on and the code the transport recognizes can never drift apart again.
- **`RATE_LIMITED` was silently downgraded to `INTERNAL`.** The `429` the Recruiter and Sales Navigator read surface returns under LinkedIn-platform throttling (dedicated `RateLimit-Policy` / `RateLimit` / `Retry-After` response headers, `retry_likely_to_succeed: true`) is a real, documented error code, but the transport's runtime known-code set omitted it — so callers received `code: "INTERNAL"`, which happened to auto-retry on `GET`/`HEAD` by accident but with the wrong (generic backoff) delay instead of honoring `Retry-After`. The transport now decodes `RATE_LIMITED` to itself and retries it on `GET`/`HEAD` like the other rate-limit codes, honoring `Retry-After`.
- **`users.update` forwarded an unsupported `description` key if a caller smuggled one in.** The `UserUpdateBody` type never declared `description`, so a typed caller was already rejected at compile time — but an untyped/JS caller (or an `as`-cast) could still put it on the object, and `update()` forwarded the body verbatim with no runtime check. `update()` now strips `description` from the outgoing payload before the request is sent, regardless of caller strictness.

---

## [0.14.1] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **`constructEvent` examples referenced a wrong header name (`X-Curviate-Signature` → `Curviate-Signature`); corrected a stale default-count description.** The JSDoc and both code examples (Express/Node, Hono) for `constructEvent` named the header `X-Curviate-Signature`; the dispatcher actually sends `Curviate-Signature` (Node lowercases it to `curviate-signature` on `req.headers`), so integrators copying the examples verbatim got `undefined` for the signature header. Also corrected the generated `events` field description on the webhook-create schema from a stale "default: all 7" to "default: all 11 lifecycle events", matching the account_status catalogue.

---

## [0.14.0] — 2026-07-07

Webhooks surface re-based onto the v2 catalogue. Additive minor: one new method,
one type-only breaking note for `CurviateEvent` (see below).

### Added

- **`webhooks.get(id)`.** Return a single webhook owned by the calling tenant (`GET /v1/webhooks/{id}`). The plaintext secret is never present on a read — only `secret_prefix`. Type `WebhookGetResult`. The `webhooks` namespace is now 7 methods (was 6).
- **Webhook event catalogue expanded 21 → 27** (`webhooks.listEvents()`), grouped messaging (8) / user (2) / account_status (14), plus 3 tier-gated. New subscribable-but-not-default events: `chat.updated`, `chat.deleted` (messaging), `connection.new` (user), `account.initial_sync.running` / `account.initial_sync.completed` / `account.initial_sync.failed` (account_status). Catalogue entries may now carry an `availability: "realtime" | "no_longer_realtime" | "not_realtime"` field.

### Changed (type-only breaking note)

- **`CurviateEvent` union re-keyed 19 → 24 deliverable events** to match the create-subscribable catalogue. Renamed/removed: `account.stopped`, `account.sync_started`, `account.sync_complete`, `account.creation_success`, `account.sync_success`, `account.reconnect_required`, `account.checkpoint` are gone; the account-lifecycle names now split across `account.synced`, `account.reconnected`, `account.reconnect_needed`, `account.paused`, `account.connecting`, `account.permission_revoked`. Net-new members: `chat.updated`, `chat.deleted`, `connection.new`, `account.initial_sync.running`, `account.initial_sync.completed`, `account.initial_sync.failed`. A `switch`/exhaustiveness check on `event.type` for any of the 7 removed names will now fail to compile — update the case list. Runtime HMAC verification (`constructEvent`) is unaffected; this is a types-only change.

---

## [0.13.0] — 2026-07-05

Accounts/Auth surface migration. This is a **breaking** minor (pre-1.0): the account
connection and checkpoint surface was reshaped end-to-end. All changes are on the
`accounts` namespace; no other namespace is affected.

### Removed (BREAKING)

- **`accounts.refresh(accountId)` removed** — the underlying endpoint (`POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/refresh`) no longer exists and has no alias. Accounts now restart and re-sync automatically; status freshness is served by the real-time account-status webhook, the nightly reconcile, and `accounts.get()`'s stale-while-revalidate background refresh. Remove any `accounts.refresh()` call sites. Type `AccountRefreshResult` is removed.
- **`accounts.submitCheckpoint(body)` removed** — renamed to `accounts.solveCheckpoint(accountId, { code })` (see below). No alias.
- **`accounts.resendCheckpoint(body)` removed** — renamed to `accounts.requestCheckpoint(accountId)` (see below). No alias.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **Checkpoint operations are now account-in-path.** The three checkpoint methods take the account id as a **path argument** instead of an `account_id` body field:
  - `submitCheckpoint({ account_id, code })` → **`solveCheckpoint(account_id, { code })`** (`POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/checkpoint/solve`). Returns the connected account (201) or a chained checkpoint (202).
  - `resendCheckpoint({ account_id })` → **`requestCheckpoint(account_id)`** (`POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/checkpoint/request`). Returns `{ object, account_id, resent }` — `resent` is still honest (`false` when there is nothing to re-send).
  - `pollCheckpoint({ account_id })` → **`pollCheckpoint(account_id)`** (`POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/checkpoint/poll`) — same name, now a single string arg (no body).
  - Migration: `submitCheckpoint({ account_id, code })` → `solveCheckpoint(account_id, { code })`; `resendCheckpoint({ account_id })` → `requestCheckpoint(account_id)`; `pollCheckpoint({ account_id })` → `pollCheckpoint(account_id)`.
  - Types: `AccountSubmitCheckpointBody`/`AccountSubmitCheckpointResult` → `AccountSolveCheckpointBody`/`AccountSolveCheckpointResult`; `AccountResendCheckpointBody`/`AccountResendCheckpointResult` → `AccountRequestCheckpointResult` (no body type); `AccountPollCheckpointBody` removed (no body).
- **`accounts.createConnectLink()` is create-only.** The `purpose` and `account_id` body fields are removed — it now only mints a link to connect a **new** account (`{ seat_id, expires_in_seconds?, redirect_url? }`). To re-authorize an existing account via a hosted link, use the new `accounts.createReconnectLink()` (below). Type `AccountConnectLinkBody` no longer carries `purpose`/`account_id`.
- **`accounts.update()` body reshaped.** The managed `country` / `ip` knobs are removed from `PATCH /v1/accounts/{account_id}`; the body is now `{ metadata?, proxy? }`. `metadata` is a flat string map that **replaces** the account's custom-data store wholesale; `proxy` sets a custom egress proxy (the managed location is now chosen at connect time, not here). Passing `country`/`ip` is rejected with `INVALID_REQUEST`. Type `AccountUpdateBody` changed. *(Known limitation: the generated body type does not yet express `proxy: null` to clear a custom proxy — the server accepts it, but a strict TypeScript caller must cast until the schema surfaces the nullability. The CLI's `account update --clear-proxy` sends it directly.)*
- **Cookie auth requires `user_agent`.** `accounts.link()` and `accounts.reconnect()` now require a `user_agent` when `auth_method: "cookie"`; without one the request is rejected with `INVALID_REQUEST`. It stays optional for `auth_method: "credentials"`. (Enforced server-side; the flat request-body type cannot make it conditionally required, so pass it whenever you connect by cookie.)
- **`accounts.reconnect()` result is now a `200 | 202` union.** A reconnect can itself surface a checkpoint challenge — resolve it with `solveCheckpoint` / `pollCheckpoint`, exactly like `accounts.link()`. Discriminate on `result.object`. Type `AccountReconnectResult` is now a union.

### Added

- **`accounts.createReconnectLink(accountId, body?)`.** Mint a one-time hosted **re-authorization** link for an existing disconnected account (`POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/reconnect-link`) — the hosted counterpart of `accounts.reconnect()`. Body is optional (`{ expires_in_seconds?, redirect_url? }`). Returns `{ object: "hosted_auth_url", url, session_id, expires_at, account_id }`; poll completion with `accounts.getConnectSession(session_id)`. Types: `AccountReconnectLinkBody`, `AccountReconnectLinkResult`. The `accounts` namespace stays at 12 methods (`refresh` out, `createReconnectLink` in).
- **New `ErrorCode` value: `ACCOUNT_ALREADY_LINKED`.** The `409` a duplicate connect now returns from `accounts.link()`, `accounts.reconnect()`, and `accounts.solveCheckpoint()` — the substrate refused linking a LinkedIn identity that's already linked. `user_fixable: true`, `retry_likely_to_succeed: false` (reconnect or disconnect the existing account instead of retrying). When the caller's own tenant already owns the existing account, the error body's `account_id` names it; otherwise it stands alone. Added to the `ErrorCode` union and the transport's known-code set — previously this narrowed to `INTERNAL`, which is retryable, so a client would have retried a request that can never succeed.
- **Wider checkpoint challenge vocabulary.** The 202 `challenge_type` enum now covers `otp | two_factor_sms | two_factor_app | two_factor_whatsapp | mobile_app_approval | otp_or_mobile_app_approval | contract_selection`, and a `contract_selection` challenge additionally carries `contracts: [{ id, name }]` (choose one and pass its id to `solveCheckpoint`).
- **422 dead-end challenge error documents a `challenge_type`, but it isn't typed yet.** When a checkpoint challenge can't be resolved automatically (e.g. a CAPTCHA or a phone-number registration), the `422` response carries a machine-readable `challenge_type: "captcha" | "phone_register"` in prose (`fixtures/openapi.json`) — but the response schema is still the generic `Error` type, so a caller can't type-branch on it programmatically yet.
- **Connect-recovery + honest terminal signals on the connection responses (additive, non-breaking).**
  - `accounts.link()` and `accounts.solveCheckpoint()` 201 responses now carry an optional `recovered` boolean — `true` only when the connect reclaimed a LinkedIn identity already present on the workspace (claiming it into your account) rather than connecting a brand-new one; absent on a normal connect.
  - The `status` on those same 201 responses is widened from `"active"` to `"active" | "reconnect_needed" | "restricted" | "disconnected"` — it now reflects the account's real observed state, which a recovered identity often reports as needing a reconnect.
  - `accounts.pollCheckpoint()` now carries `challenge_type` (`"mobile_app_approval"`) and a human-readable `recovery_hint` on a `status: "expired"` mobile-approval timeout, so a client can render the right recovery guidance without parsing prose.

### Changed

- Regenerated types from the current API surface. `accounts.get()` / `accounts.list()` still return the six cached enrichment fields, but `username`, `premium_id`, `public_identifier`, `signatures`, and `groups` are no longer refreshed by background enrichment — they read `null`/`[]` for newly connected accounts (any previously cached value is retained). `full_name` and `substrate_created_at` continue to populate; `substrate_created_at` remains ISO-8601 UTC.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added

- **New `companies` namespace (5 methods).** `companies.get(identifier)` retrieves a company's full LinkedIn profile — accepts either a public handle (the slug in `linkedin.com/company/<handle>`, e.g. `"t-systems"`) or a numeric id. `companies.employees(identifier, params?)`, `companies.posts(identifier, params?)`, and `companies.jobs(identifier, params?)` list company sub-resources (filterable with `keywords`/`location` where supported); `companies.followers(identifier, params?)` lists company followers (requires the acting account to administer the target page). The four sub-resource methods require the company's **numeric provider_id** (the same `id` field `companies.get()` returns) — a handle or URN is rejected server-side before any upstream call. Types: `CompanyProfile`, `CompanyEmployeeListPage`, `CompanyPostListPage`, `CompanyJobListPage`, `CompanyFollowerListPage`.
- **New `ErrorCode` value: `RESOURCE_ACCESS_RESTRICTED`.** The non-admin mapping for `companies.followers()` — surfaced when the acting account does not administer the target company page. Added to the `ErrorCode` union and the transport's known-code set (previously unknown codes silently narrowed to `INTERNAL`).
- **`salesNavigator` gains 5 new v2 list-surface methods (7→12).** `salesNavigator.accountLists(query?)` and `salesNavigator.leadLists(query?)` list the operator's saved-account/saved-lead lists (`account_id` required, `limit`/`cursor` paginate). `salesNavigator.browseAccountList(listId, body?, query?)` and `salesNavigator.browseLeadList(listId, body?, query?)` return the saved items in one list, with optional enum filters (`filter`/`sort_by`/`sort_order` for accounts; `spotlight`/`sort_by`/`sort_order` for leads) in the body. `salesNavigator.saveAccount({ list_id, company_id, account_id })` saves a company into an account list — a `2xx` response **is** the success signal; no `saved` boolean is invented. All five are additive. Types: `SNAccountListsQuery/Result`, `SNLeadListsQuery/Result`, `SNBrowseAccountListQuery/Body/Result`, `SNBrowseLeadListQuery/Body/Result`, `SNSaveAccountBody/Input/Result`.

### Removed (BREAKING)

- **`profiles.getCompany(companyId)` removed** — hard-moved to `companies.get(identifier)`. The underlying endpoint (`GET /v1/profiles/companies/{company_id}`) no longer exists; there is no alias. Update call sites to `companies.get()`.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **`salesNavigator.saveLead` re-signed for the v2 save-lead surface.** The v1 `saveLead(userId, { account_id, list_id? })` (`POST /v1/sales-navigator/leads/{user_id}`) is **retired, no alias** — the endpoint itself no longer exists server-side. The replacement `saveLead({ list_id, user_id, account_id })` calls `POST /v1/sales-navigator/lead-lists/{list_id}/save`; `list_id` is now **mandatory** (the v1 `list_id`-optional semantics do not exist in v2) and addresses the path instead of the member id. Update call sites: `saveLead(userId, { account_id, list_id })` → `saveLead({ list_id, user_id, account_id })`. Types: `SNSaveLeadBody`/`SNSaveLeadResult` now alias the v2 endpoint; new `SNSaveLeadInput`.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added

- **`accounts.getConnectSession(session_id)`.** Poll a hosted connect session minted by `accounts.createConnectLink()`. A pure status read — it makes no external call and does not itself complete the connection (the connection is signalled complete out-of-band once the end user finishes the hosted flow). Returns `{ object: "connect_session", session_id, status, account_id, expires_at }`, where `status` is `"pending" | "resolved" | "expired" | "failed"` and `account_id` is populated only once `status` is `"resolved"`. Poll until it leaves `pending`. Type: `AccountConnectSessionResult`. Extends the Accounts surface to 12 methods.
- **`accounts.resendCheckpoint({ account_id })`.** Re-sends the pending verification challenge notification for an account (e.g. when the end user says they never received the OTP/2FA code or the mobile-app push). Returns `{ object: "checkpoint", account_id, resent }` — `resent` echoes the outcome honestly (`false` when there was nothing to re-send for that challenge type; this never throws just because a resend wasn't applicable). Does not reset the checkpoint's expiry.
- **`session_id` on the `accounts.createConnectLink()` 201 response** — the durable poll handle to pass to `accounts.getConnectSession()`. Type: `AccountConnectLinkResult`.
- **`seat_id` on the account-connection responses.** `accounts.link()` (201), `accounts.submitCheckpoint()` (201), and `accounts.pollCheckpoint()` now carry `seat_id` (`string | null`) — the seat the account occupies. `accounts.createConnectLink()` (201) also carries it. This is the canonical replacement for the deprecated `attached_seat_id` (same value).
- **`auth_method: "hosted"`** is now a possible value on `accounts.list()` items (accounts connected through a hosted link). Response-only — the `link()` / `reconnect()` request `auth_method` remains `"credentials" | "cookie"`.
- **`"disconnected"` account status.** Now a possible `status` on `accounts.list()` items, `accounts.get()`, and both sides of the account `state-diff` event — whose `previous_status` / `current_status` are now typed enums (`"active" | "reconnect_needed" | "restricted" | "connecting" | "disconnected"`) rather than free-form strings.

### Deprecated

- **`attached_seat_id`** (on `accounts.link()`, `accounts.submitCheckpoint()`, and `accounts.pollCheckpoint()` responses) — use `seat_id` instead (identical value). Retained for backward compatibility; slated for removal at the GA `/v1` cutover.

### Changed

- Regenerated types from the current API surface (full refresh). Beyond the additions above, `accounts.update()` (`PATCH /v1/accounts/{account_id}`) gains a `501` response variant, returned when a managed-proxy configuration isn't supported for the account's current plan (not retryable as-is — change the request rather than resubmitting). No resource method signatures changed.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **New `jobs` namespace.** `jobs.get(jobIdOrUrl)` retrieves one public LinkedIn job posting's full detail — title, company, location, description, applicant count, and more. Accepts either a bare numeric job id (e.g. `"4428113858"`) or a full job URL (`"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4428113858"`) — the SDK extracts the numeric id client-side, so both forms issue the identical request. Passing a value with no extractable numeric id throws `CurviateError({ code: "INVALID_REQUEST" })` synchronously, before any network call. Type: `JobPosting`.
- `recruiter.getJob(jobIdOrUrl)` — the Recruiter-lens sibling, retrieving any public job posting (not only the operator's own postings). Accepts the same bare-id-or-URL forms as `jobs.get()` and returns the identical `JobPosting` type (no separate response shape to learn). Extends the Recruiter surface to 18 methods.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Account enrichment fields.** `accounts.list()` items and `accounts.get()` now carry six cached account-detail fields, populated by an async background enrichment on every successful account activation: `username`, `premium_id`, `public_identifier`, `substrate_created_at` (ISO-8601 UTC), `signatures` (`{title, content}[]`), and `groups` (`string[]`). All six are `null`/`[]` until the account's first enrichment pass completes — never `undefined`, never a missing key. Types: `AccountListPage`, `AccountDetail`.
- `accounts.get()` gains `seat_id` (`string | null`) — the seat the account occupies, `null` for an admin seatless account. Previously only `accounts.list()` items carried this field.

### Changed

- `connected_at` (on both `accounts.list()` items and `accounts.get()`) and `last_checked_at` (`accounts.get()`) now consistently emit ISO-8601 UTC (`…Z`) timestamps — a prior docs-vs-runtime drift meant these could reach callers in raw Postgres wire format. No type change (already typed as `string`/`string | null`); this is a runtime-correctness fix reflected in the regenerated example values.
- Regenerated types from the current API surface. No resource method signatures changed — purely additive response fields.
- `quotas[]` (on `accounts.get()`) is now documented as advisory usage-safety recommendations: daily families never cause a rejected request; only `account.per_minute` is a binding limit enforced with HTTP 429. `recommended_throttle_hint` semantics documented per level (`none` / `slow_down` / `backoff` are advisory; `stop` is reserved for the binding per-minute limit). JSDoc-only — no type shape change.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Recruiter job-lifecycle endpoints are now fully implemented server-side.** The following operations no longer return `501` and are safe to call in production: getting/rejecting an applicant, downloading an applicant's resume, listing a job's applicants, solving a job's publish checkpoint, publishing a job, and fetching a Recruiter profile. Their generated response types no longer include a `501` variant — if your code branched on it, that branch is now dead and can be removed.
- Richer parameter documentation across the Recruiter and search surfaces: job/applicant/hiring-project IDs now describe where to obtain them (e.g. `job_id` from `GET /v1/recruiter/jobs`, `user_id` from a people-search result), and several previously-terse descriptions were corrected (e.g. the saved-search `industry` filter's cross-reference).
- Server-side parameter defaults are now surfaced in the generated JSDoc (`@default`) wherever the API applies one when a param is omitted — link-expiry seconds, chat visibility, hiring-project list `limit`, webhook delivery `format`/`enabled`/`headers`/`data`, and more.
- **Breaking (typed consumers):** the Sales Navigator company-search `annual_revenue.min`/`max` filter is now a bucketed numeric enum (`0 | 0.2 | 1 | 2.5 | 5 | 10 | 20 | 50 | 100 | 500 | 1000 | 1001`) instead of a free-form `number`, matching what the API actually accepts. Code passing arbitrary numbers no longer typechecks — pick the nearest bucket value. Runtime behavior is unchanged (the API already only accepted these buckets).

### Changed

- **Search filter guard-rails are now documented.** `search.companies` `limit` requires a minimum of 2 (was 1) — the API rejects single-result company searches. `search.jobs` `benefits` and `commitments` filters now document their accepted values. `search.people` `open_to` now documents its accepted values (`proBono`, `boardMember`). The `search.posts` request examples were corrected to use the actual `member`/`company` array filter shape instead of a `member_urn` string.
- Regenerated types from the current API surface. No resource method signatures changed.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-01

### Changed

- **Breaking (typed consumers):** `recruiter.startChat` 201 response — the `attendee_ids` field is removed and replaced by `message_id` (the opening message identifier). Final shape: `{ object: "chat_started", chat_id, message_id }`, matching `messaging.startChat` and `salesNavigator.startChat`. `chat_id` is now non-nullable on a 201. Type: `RecruiterStartChatResult`. Migration: read `res.message_id`.
  - *Why:* product-API + core / Sales Navigator parity — the underlying LinkedIn start-chat operation returns an identical `{ object, chat_id, message_id }` for every product; the prior `attendee_ids` echo had no product-API basis.
- The `recruiter.startChat` request body is unchanged (`attendees_ids` plus all recruiter-specific params).
- Regenerated types from the updated API surface.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Recruiter start-chat response gains `object: "chat_started"` discriminator.** The 201 response from `recruiter.startChat` now includes `object: "chat_started"` as a required field. Type: `RecruiterStartChatResult`.

### Changed

- **Breaking (typed consumers):** `salesNavigator.syncMessages` and `recruiter.syncMessages` — the 200 response field `sync_status` is renamed to `status`. Enum values (`sync_started | running | done | error`) are unchanged. Types: `SNSyncMessagesResult`, `RecruiterSyncMessagesResult`.
- **Breaking (typed consumers):** `recruiter.startChat` request body field `attendee_ids` → `attendees_ids`. The **response** `attendee_ids` field is unchanged. Type: `RecruiterStartChatBody`.
- Recruiter start-chat 201 response no longer surfaces a separate `quota` field — remaining InMail capacity is read from `GET /v1/accounts/{account_id}`.
- Regenerated types from the updated API surface (SN/Recruiter messaging parity).

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added

- Posts search gains nested `posted_by`, `mentioning`, and `author` filter objects. `posted_by` and `mentioning` take `member` / `company` arrays of opaque IDs (from `GET /v1/search/parameters`); `posted_by` also accepts `me`, `first_connections`, and `people_you_follow` booleans; `author` filters by `industry`, `company`, or `keywords`.
- Search-parameters items (`GET /v1/search/parameters`) now carry nullable company-disambiguation fields — `industry`, `location`, `headcount` (human-readable size range), and `followers_count` — populated only for `type=COMPANY` results.

### Changed

- **Breaking (typed consumers):** people-search `connections_of` and `followers_of` are now arrays of opaque member IDs (`string[]`) instead of a single `string`. Pass one or more IDs resolved from `GET /v1/search/parameters`.
- **Breaking (typed consumers):** posts-search replaces the flat `member_urn` / `company_urn` filters with the nested `posted_by` / `mentioning` / `author` objects described above.
- **Breaking (typed consumers):** jobs-search `location_within_area` is now a `number` (search radius in miles) instead of a `string`.
- Company-size (`headcount`) bucket bounds are documented with their explicit valid values.
- De-branded the four search method summaries in the SDK JSDoc (`Search people/companies/posts/jobs`).
- Regenerated types from the current API surface.

---

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-01

### Added

- Invitation item `specifics` now includes `provider: "LINKEDIN"` on both `InvitationSent` and `InvitationReceived` — the platform the invitation belongs to, passed through alongside `shared_secret`.

### Changed

- Removed the `422` response from `invites.cancel` (`DELETE /v1/invites/{invitation_id}`) and `invites.respond` (`POST /v1/invites/received/{invitation_id}`): cancel is idempotent (`canceled`/`not_found` only) and a non-pending handle returns `not_found`, so neither surfaces an account-restricted `422`.
- Regenerated types from the current API surface, consolidating the invitation-item changes on top of the 0.4.1 people-search and 0.4.0 profile/messaging types.

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-06-30

### Added

- `people_search_result` item now includes `id: string` — the raw LinkedIn provider id for the person (e.g. `ACoAA…` format). This is the first property on the item type.

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added

- `primary_locale` (`{ country, language } | null`) on the `Profile` and `OwnProfile` types — a profile's primary locale as set by LinkedIn (`language` is a BCP 47 tag, `country` an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code). Present on `GET /v1/profiles/{id}`; on `/me` it is populated when `linkedin_sections` is supplied.

### Changed

- The account re-sync response (`GET /v1/messages/sync`) field is now `status` (was `sync_status`), aligning with the chat-history sync response. Sales Navigator and Recruiter re-sync responses are unchanged (`sync_status`).
- Regenerated types from the current API: refreshed endpoint and error descriptions to neutral wording. No request shapes changed.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added

- `sendInMail` now accepts `surface: "classic"` for sending InMail from an account's own premium InMail credits (in addition to `"sales_nav"` and `"recruiter"`). The `recipient_urn` field accepts either a member URN (`urn:li:member:<id>`) or a member provider id (`ACo…`).

### Changed

- Regenerated types from the current API: refreshed several endpoint descriptions (message delete, post id forms, reaction list) to match the live reference. No request/response shapes changed beyond the `surface` addition above.

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- `deleteMessage` and `addReaction` no longer inject `account_id` into the request. The server resolves the owning account from the message id — sending a client-supplied `account_id` was rejected by the server's strict schema, making both methods unusable via `client.account(id)`. The server's schemas are also relaxed (patch on the server side) so existing SDK installs continue to work without updating.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-28

### Added

- `profiles.getMe(params?)` now accepts an optional `linkedin_sections` array to request specific LinkedIn profile sections (e.g. education, experience, skills); responses include only the requested enrichment fields.
- `OwnProfile` type is normalized: `is_premium` and `is_open_profile` are always present on the response. Enriched section fields (`headline`, `summary`, `work_experience`, `education`, `skills`, and more) are present when the corresponding section was requested.
- `Chat` type now includes a `subject` field (nullable string) reflecting the conversation subject where available.

### Changed

- Array-valued query parameters are now serialized as repeated keys (`?key=a&key=b`) rather than as a comma-joined string. This matches the server's expected format for array parameters such as `linkedin_sections`.

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Account-scoped write requests now send the account identifier in the request body where the API expects it. Previously the account identifier was always sent as a query parameter, regardless of the operation, which caused account-scoped write requests (sending invitations and InMail, posting and commenting, reacting, endorsing, saving leads, and the Recruiter pipeline writes) to be rejected. Read requests, body-less deletes, and filter-search requests are unaffected — they continue to carry the account identifier as a query parameter, matching the API. An account identifier you pass explicitly in a request still takes precedence and is never overwritten.

---
